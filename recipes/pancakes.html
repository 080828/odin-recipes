    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This secret family pancake recipe was passed down from my grandfather.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup milk, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 egg, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; make a 'well' in the center of the flour mixture. Pour milk, eggs, and 1 tablespoon oil into the well. Mix until well moistened.</li>
      <li>Place a griddle over medium-high heat; sprinkle a few drops of water onto the griddle. If the droplets bounce, the griddle is ready; add 2 teaspoons oil.</li>
      <li>Spoon batter onto the griddle; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 5 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
